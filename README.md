# OpenWesabe / Mesabe installer

This script is known to install cleanly against Ubuntu or Ubuntu Server
10.04.  It may work on Debian as well (but probably not without some
changes).

To install:

    wget http://github.com/nylen/openwesabe-installer/blob/master/openwesabe-installer.sh
    bash openwesabe-installer.sh

Then follow the on-screen instructions.  Some steps will take a long time.
